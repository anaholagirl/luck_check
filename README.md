#LUCK_CHECK

###Linda Gibson and Marina Neumann

##In certain places tickets of certain combinations of numbers can be considered lucky.  For instance, if you take a set of numbers and the sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half, that set of numbers is considered lucky.  This program is designed to determine if a set of given numbers whether even or odd would be considered lucky.
